**Spring Boot**

Spring Boot is a framework that aims to make it easy to create a Spring based application.
Spring Boot makes the programmer's job easier in the following ways:
1. Automatic application configuration
2. Managing dependencies in maven projects
3. Built-in server support.The application itself has a server on which it can run. But it is also still possible to install a Spring Boot application on some server.
